# Processor-Simulator
Two part C++ project where one program creates and organizes a file of 10000 random jobs and the second program uses that file as input to simulate how an input # of processors will handle those jobs (up to 8 processors recommended).


Each folder, "Simulator" and "File Generator" is a separate C++ project created in Visual Studio. You should be able to open those folders separately within VS and run them. I apologize for how long the file generator takes to run, please give it around 5 minutes.
